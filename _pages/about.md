I'm a master's student in [RPM Robotics Lab](http://rpm.snu.ac.kr) at Seoul National University [SNU](https://www.snu.ac.kr), being advised by Prof. Ayoung Kim. My research primarily focuses on Autonomous Driving, Radar Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Sensor Fusion, and Deep Learning. Currently, I'm researching heterogeneous radar SLAM for SLAM in adverse weather conditions.

Prior to this, I was an undergraduate researcher in the [IDIM Robotics Lab](https://fab.snu.ac.kr/) at Seoul National University [SNU](https://www.snu.ac.kr), being advised by Prof. Sung-Hoon Ahn. My research topic during my undergraduate researcher was a vision-based collaborative robot automation and voice control system using autonomous mobile robot arms.
