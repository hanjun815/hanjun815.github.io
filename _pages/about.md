I'm a master's student in RPM Robotics Lab at Seoul National University (SNU), being advised by Prof. Ayoung Kim. Currently, I'm focusing on radar, LiDAR, and quadrupedal robot applications for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), sensor fusion and deep learning. My interest lies at the intersection of these cutting-edge technologies, exploring their integration for advanced perception and navigation systems.

A head of this, I was a M.S. student in RPM Robotics Lab at SNU. During my M.S. studies, my research concentrated on mitigating the vertical odometry drift of quadrupedal robots by leveraging radar sensor data and leg kinematics analysis. Furthermore, I carried through numerous academic works related to the SLAM in degenerated environments, including LiDAR-based SLAM, heterogeneous sensor fusion, deep learning based data conversion, etc.
